CPAN-Access-AdHoc is Copyright (C) 2012 by Thomas R. Wyant, III

DESCRIPTION

This package provides classes to do ad-hoc access to a CPAN repository.
It does not provide any functionality to actually install modules. What
it does provide is an API to query a CPAN repository as to its contents,
or to retrieve individual packages, individual files from packages, or
the metadata for a package.

You can configure the CPAN repository to query via a configuration file.
Absent a configuration file, the repository will be the user's Mini CPAN
(if present), the user's configured CPAN repository (if any), the user's
configured cpanminus repository (if any), or the user's configured
CPANPLUS repository.

See the eg/ directory for samples.

INSTALLATION

This package is installable by either of the two usual incantations:

    tar -xzf CPAN-Access-AdHoc-9.999.tar.gz
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    tar -xzf CPAN-Access-AdHoc-9.999.tar.gz
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the CPAN/Access/ directory (creating it if necessary)
in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
