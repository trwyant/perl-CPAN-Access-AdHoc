  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
  Remove all methods deprecated in 0.000_03.
  Change the way CPAN::Access::AdHoc::Archive::Null looks at its
    contents. Specifically:
    * base_directory() now returns the directory portion of the path()
      attribute -- unless this looks like the path of a distribution, in
      which case it returns the directory relative to the authors/id/
      directory.
    * list_content() now returns just the base name of the enclosed
      file.
    * The get_item_*() and item_present() methods just take the base
      name of the enclosed file.
    * extract() creates directories as specified by the base_directory()
      method.
  OTHER CHANGES
  Add to CPAN::Access::AdHoc::Archive an umbrella handle_http_response()
    method that iterates over the subclasses returning the first archive
    object actually manufactures, or nothing if none of the subclasses
    know how to handle the argument.
  Rely on LWP::MediaTypes for MIME information, rathr than doing our own
    guessing.
  Guard against undefined value warnings when fetching unpackaged
    distributions such as
    T/TO/TOMC/scripts/whenon.dir/LastLog/File.pm.gz
  Abort the build if $Config{useperlio} is false, since we use this to
    make a file handle out of the data returned from the CPAN
    repository.

0.000_03	2012-01-10	T. R. Wyant
  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
  The CPAN::Access::AdHoc::Archive::Null handle_http_response() static
    method now returns a CPAN::Access::AdHoc::Archive::Null object,
    rather than the content of the file.
  The CPAN::Access::AdHoc fetch_package_archive() method is deprecated
    in favor of the fetch_distribution_archive() method. The deprecated
    method will go away before the first production release.
  The CPAN::Access::AdHoc fetch_registered_module_index() now returns a
    reference to a hash contining the module index, rather than a string
    that needs to be eval-ed.
  OTHER CHANGES
  Add method fetch_distribution_checksums() to CPAN::Access::AdHoc.
  Have the CPAN::Access::AdHoc fetch() method actually check checksums.
  Add method get_item_mtime() to the CPAN::Access::AdHoc::Archive
    classes.
  The CPAN::Access::AdHoc cpan() mutator now validates URLs using
    URI::URL.

0.000_02	2012-01-06	T. R. Wyant
  The CPAN::Access::AdHoc default_cpan_source() mutator now validates
    its argument, and croaks on an error.
  The CPAN::Access::AdHoc cpan() mutator now croaks if its argument was
    undef and no default can be computed.
  Check in CPAN::Access::AdHoc for failure when opening string
    references, and croak with error if needed.
  CPAN::Access::AdHoc::Default::CPAN::CPAN::Mini now explicitly converts
    the local repository path to POSIX before making a file: URL out of
    it.
  Add dependency on Module::Pluggable::Object, in lieu of home-grown
    plugin code.
  Review and update dependencies.
  Add author tests without optional modules CPANPLUS, CPAN::Mini and
    App::cpanminus.
  Add 'cpan' and 'cpan_default_source' commands to eg/cpan-adhoc, and
    have the 'help' command not exit.
